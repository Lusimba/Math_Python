Question:


The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:


f(n)=0 if n=0
f(n)=1 if n=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1

Please write a program to compute the value of f(n) with a given n input by console.

Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:

7

Then, the output of the program should be:

13

In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Hints:
We can define recursive function in Python.


Solution:

def f(n):
    if n == 0: return 0
    elif n == 1: return 1
    else: return f(n-1)+f(n-2)

n=int(raw_input())
print f(n)









Question:
Define a class named Circle which can be constructed by a radius. The Circle class has a method which can compute the area. 

Hints:

Use def methodName(self) to define a method.

Solution:

class Circle(object):
    def __init__(self, r):
        self.radius = r

    def area(self):
        return self.radius**2*3.14

aCircle = Circle(2)
print aCircle.area()
