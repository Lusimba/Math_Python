Use static, class, and instance methods in this exercise

Write python code to transfer money between two bank accounts belonging to the same bank 
(hint: you must use lists to store account numbers and account names).
a. Ask the user for his/her bank account and check if the bank account exists (check for 
availability on the list). If the account number provided is absent from the list,
return an error message. 
b. If the account number exists, print the account number and name as
"Hello XYZ, your account number is ###" (hint: use list.index and other list access methods) 
c. Ask the user for the recipient account and confirm that the account exists. 
d. transfer funds from sender's account (initial balance = 10, 000 INR) and show a success message. 

Note:   The account numbers must exist in the bank. If the accounts do not exist, exit the execution sequence. 
        Ask for the valid bank account for a maximum of three times, after which you exit the execution sequence.
